By taking in reports of municipal issue, you can track down and address the concerns of the public. You might already be recording these issues from a form on your website or paying for a service that helps you track this information. Buoy Maps is diffrent, allowing anyone to say something if they see a problem. We get more reports because users no long have to worry about what legal juristdiction they are in, or having an account with their cities public works department. If they see a pothole, broken street lamp, overflowing trash can; they can submit an observation.

Taking credit for all your hard work is also important. As you remediate issues your organization can update observations to mark them resoloved.
