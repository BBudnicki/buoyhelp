Buoy Maps is a social network where every post is a pin on the map. As a platfrom we focus on mapping point based data for [different stakeholders](docs/). There are 2 key features of the service:
## Observations
Observations are the posts within the Buoy Maps social network. Every Observation has a location, time, and whatever other details you wish to add including photos. These observations can be shared with different groups and explored within interactive maps.


## Groups
Groups allow you to organize and catalog observations. Like any social network they are made up of members submitting observations. Your group might be focused on a citizen science project, community organization, or municipal goverment. Groups get to define the types of obvservations they would like to collect, defining the details that people include, where they are located, and any #hastags they wish to use.
