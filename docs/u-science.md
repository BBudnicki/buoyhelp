Citizen Science is the practice of involving citizens within the scientific process. As a data collection tool, Buoy Maps focuses on the collection of point based observations. Every post has a latitude, longitude, timestamp, and additional fields your group would like to collect. This can be used for environmental or ecological research and allows you to collect a broad scope of data you would otherwise be able to.

Buoy Maps is a natural progression of citizen Science like the emergence of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) was for encyclopedias. First you had encyclopedias: written and maintained by experts, each with updates and new additions in incremental steps. Then you had wiki's for communities focused on niche areas; video games, software development, and communities groups. Wikipedia brought both concepts together to become an encyclopedia created by the public. Buoy Maps, as a general purpose social network for creating observations, goes beyond a specific niche to attract a broad audience. We invite everyone to contribute to Citizen Science.

## Citizen Science Communities
There are wonderful Citizen Science platforms that allow submitting point based observations, each tailored to specific interests: [iNaturalist](https://inaturlist.org) for spotting wildlife, [eBird](https://ebird.org) for Bird Watching, [EDD Maps](https://www.eddmaps.org/) for tracking invasive species. They all do a great job but bring in different audiences. Buoy Maps brings all types of observations under a single roof so users have a consistent place to report sightings regardless of focus.

If you are not already, we encourage you to check out the project organizations resources of the [Citizen Science Association](https://www.citizenscience.org/) and the indexes of projects maintained by [citsci.org](https://www.citsci.org)


## Project Spotlight
