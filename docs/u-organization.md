Buoy Maps helps organizations improve the well being of their communities as a tool for organization. By reporting challenges at specific locations or improvements you make you are sharing important information with you neighbors.

Take for example a neighbohood cleanup. You might first make observations of major issues: old couches in alleys, or refregerators stuck in a nearby stream. Then with that map you can plan how to properly dispose of those things. Finally you can report that you cleaned those things up and take credit for making your neighborhood a better place. Working as a community you don't have to do it on your own and by working together you can acomplish more than you would alone.
